# Jenkins Jobs for Cloudflare DNS A Records

This repository contains a collection of Jenkins pipeline jobs (Jenkinsfiles) that make it easy to manage Cloudflare DNS A records.  
With these automated jobs, you can add, update, delete, or list A-type DNS records in your Cloudflare zones directly from Jenkins.

Simply choose the Jenkinsfile you need, configure it with your Cloudflare credentials and desired parameters, and run DNS operations as part of your CI/CD workflow.
